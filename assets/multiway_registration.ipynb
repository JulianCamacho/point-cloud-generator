    "## Pose graph\n",
    "A pose graph has two key elements: nodes and edges. A node is a piece of geometry $\\mathbf{P}_{i}$ associated with a pose matrix $\\mathbf{T}_{i}$ which transforms $\\mathbf{P}_{i}$ into the global space. The set $\\{\\mathbf{T}_{i}\\}$ are the unknown variables to be optimized. `PoseGraph.nodes` is a list of `PoseGraphNode`. We set the global space to be the space of $\\mathbf{P}_{0}$. Thus $\\mathbf{T}_{0}$ is the identity matrix. The other pose matrices are initialized by accumulating transformation between neighboring nodes. The neighboring nodes usually have large overlap and can be registered with [Point-to-plane ICP](../pipelines/icp_registration.ipynb#point-to-plane-ICP).\n",
    "\n",
    "A pose graph edge connects two nodes (pieces of geometry) that overlap. Each edge contains a transformation matrix $\\mathbf{T}_{i,j}$ that aligns the source geometry $\\mathbf{P}_{i}$ to the target geometry $\\mathbf{P}_{j}$. This tutorial uses [Point-to-plane ICP](../pipelines/icp_registration.ipynb#point-to-plane-ICP) to estimate the transformation. In more complicated cases, this pairwise registration problem should be solved via [Global registration](global_registration.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "[\\[Choi2015\\]](../reference.html#choi2015) has observed that pairwise registration is error-prone. False pairwise alignments can outnumber correctly aligned pairs. Thus, they partition pose graph edges into two classes. **Odometry edges** connect temporally close, neighboring nodes. A local registration algorithm such as ICP can reliably align them. **Loop closure edges** connect any non-neighboring nodes. The alignment is found by global registration and is less reliable. In Open3D, these two classes of edges are distinguished by the `uncertain` parameter in the initializer of `PoseGraphEdge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the transformation matrix $\\mathbf{T}_{i}$, the user can set an information matrix $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}_{i}$ for each edge. If $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}_{i}$ is set using function `get_information_matrix_from_point_clouds`, the loss on this pose graph edge approximates the RMSE of the corresponding sets between the two nodes, with a line process weight. Refer to Eq (3) to (9) in [\\[Choi2015\\]](../reference.html#choi2015) and [the Redwood registration benchmark](http://redwood-data.org/indoor/registration.html) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script creates a pose graph with three nodes and three edges. Among the edges, two of them are odometry edges (`uncertain = False`) and one is a loop closure edge (`uncertain = True`)."
