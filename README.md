# point-cloud-generator
This project, developed for the course CE-5302: Computer Engineering Design Project, focuses on the implementation of an algorithm for point cloud stacking without camera pose information. Using techniques from computer vision and photogrammetry, the project aims to generate three-dimensional maps from individual point clouds.
